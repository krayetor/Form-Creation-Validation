### Deep Dive into JavaScript
Welcome to the “Deep Dive into JavaScript” project! In this project, you will develop a user registration form with validation and fetch user data from a public API. This project will enhance your understanding of form validation, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous JavaScript.

You will learn how to:

- Validate form inputs using JavaScript.
- Dynamically interact with HTML elements.
- Fetch and display data from a public API.
- Provide real-time feedback to users.

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and be able to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students should be able to:

1. <strong>Implement Form Validation:</strong>
- Understand and implement basic form       validation using JavaScript.
- Ensure user inputs meet specified criteria before form submission.

2. <strong>Work with the DOM:</strong>
- Use DOM manipulation to dynamically interact with HTML elements.
- Understand and utilize event listeners for form submission and input validation.

3. <strong>Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs:</strong>
- Use JavaScript to fetch data asynchronously from a public API.
- Display fetched data dynamically on a webpage.
- Handle potential errors during data fetching.

4. <strong>Enhance User Experience:</strong>
- Provide real-time feedback to users for form validation.
- Ensure data persists across browser sessions using local storage.
